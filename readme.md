# Piperag GGML

**Piperag GGML** is a [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml)-based project by Ekincan Casim that demonstrates [describe what your project does – e.g., "an efficient inference engine for large language models," "a lightweight implementation for machine learning inference," or any specific purpose your project has]. This project leverages the performance and flexibility of GGML to provide [key features, e.g., "optimized model inference," "cross-platform support," etc.].

## Overview

Piperag GGML is designed to:
- **Efficiently load and run models:** [Brief description about model handling if applicable]
- **Optimize inference speed:** Using the GGML library for fast matrix operations and low-memory footprint.
- **Serve as a reference implementation:** For developers interested in integrating GGML into their own projects.

## Features

- **Optimized Inference:** Leverages GGML for high-performance model inference.
- **Lightweight & Portable:** Designed to run on various platforms with minimal dependencies.
- **Easy Integration:** Provides a clear example of how to use GGML in your own projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [GGML](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) library (ensure you have the required C/C++ build tools installed)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for building the project
- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eccsm/piperag_ggml.git
   cd piperag_ggml
   ```
2. **Configure and Build:**

    Create a build directory and run CMake:
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```
3. **Run the Application:**

    Once built, you can run the resulting executable. For example:

    ```bash
    ./piperag_ggml_executable
    ```
    (Replace piperag_ggml_executable with the actual name of your built binary.)

### Usage

Include brief instructions on how to use the project. For example:

- **Command-line Options:**

    Describe any command-line options, e.g.:

     ```bash
    ./piperag_ggml_executable --model path/to/model.bin --threads 4
     ```
  
- **API Usage (if applicable):**

    If your project provides a library API, include a simple code snippet showing how to call its main functions.
